--- Homework 4 ---

In this homework assignment, I completed the exercise on page 180 of Chapter 5, “Other APIs,”
by researching third-party Web Service APIs that might be incorporated into Project 1.

1.	Brief description of my team’s project:
The project is a social site, a mentor finder in particular, where students can meet industry
professionals with similar interests and backgrounds. Each member has a favorite list for
different topics. Members can find and contact other members who favorited similar items.

2.	A list of APIs that could be useful for our project and brief descriptions of how each
API’s functionality might be used:
<br>--- LinkedIn ---
<br>* - Our project’s members can sign in using their LinkedIn account
<br>* - We can pull background info and other work- and experience-related information that would
help in matching students and potential mentors
<br>--- Facebook Graph ---
<br>* Using this API, we can track members’ likes and dislikes so that the application can match
based on compatibility
<br>--- foursquare ---
<br>* foursquare would help students and industry professionals set up meetings/outings with each
other easier and more efficiently

3.	Here is one API from the list (with attached screenshot of web page):
<br>--- LinkedIn ---
<br>* I wanted to use this API to allow a member to click a button to sign in with their 
LinkedIn account, then be redirected back to the homepage

4.	A description of why I chose this  API and the link to the documentation:
I chose this API because it is a natural choice for any application having to do with networking
and building professional relationships. <https://developer.linkedin.com/docs>

5.	Potential issues that I foresee with using this API in our project:
There may be some of us in the group that have not worked with APIs before, so it may take them
some time to learn to use them. I have worked with APIs before but only with Django and Python.

6.	An evaluation of my experience creating the example web page and a recommendation of whether
my team should use this API or keep searching:
This seems like a great API to use for this project if we do go ahead and implement a mentor
finder. I had a rougher time than I expected trying to load the LinkedIn JavaScript library,
even when I used python –m SimpleHTTPServer.

7.	A description of how this example I wrote might be expanded to use additional functionality
provided by the API:
I could use the LinkedIn API to gather information about members’ backgrounds, education, and
skills to match them with each other.
